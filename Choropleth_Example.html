  <h3>U.S. States where MLB Players played college baseball</h3>
  <p>Do MLB Players favor playing at colleges located in warm-weather states? Select a different time period to see the change in demographics.</p>
  <p><strong>COLOR LEGEND:</strong> the darker the reddish color, the higher the number of MLB players that played college baseball in that state. Hover over any state to find out how many!</p>
  <p><strong>Did you notice?</strong> When you change time periods, the colors of the states don't seem to change. But try hovering over a few of the same states for different time periods.</p>
  <p>The number of MLB players in each state DOES change by time period! That means MLB players have historically played their college baseball in the same warm weather states.</p>
